          <p style="max-width:200px; overflow:scroll;">We built the application with you in mind. The essence of it is to make your experience as good as can be. That's why we implemented Autoplay, Next Episode, and Resume playing. You can expect the Skip Intro feature soon enough too ! </p>

          <p style="max-width:200px; overflow:scroll;">When we started building this app, having a simple and yet beautiful user interface was one of the main goals. There is nothing fancy about it, but the usability does make up for all of that, and then some.</p>

          <p style="max-width:200px; overflow:scroll;">The application uses electron, so its basically chrome under the hood. That's why you will always get fast starting time, and thanks to Vue, once you're inside, the experience will be the same.</p>
